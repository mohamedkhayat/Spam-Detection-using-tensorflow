### Overview
The **Spam Detection App** is a practical project designed to apply TensorFlow and NLP techniques for classifying spam messages. This project builds on concepts from the *Machine Learning Specialization* and the book *Natural Language Processing in Action* to create, train, and deploy an effective spam detection model.

### Key Features

- **Spam Detection Model:** Utilizes TensorFlow and LSTM networks to develop and train a model for spam classification.
- **Data Processing:** Implements text preprocessing steps, including tokenization, padding, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
- **Flask API:** Deploys the trained model using Flask for real-time spam classification.
- **Java Frontend:** Features a Java-based frontend that interacts with the Flask API to handle user inputs and display classification results.

### Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow:** For developing and training NLP models with LSTM layers.
- **Python & Flask:** For deploying the model as an API.
- **Java:** For creating the frontend application.
- **NLP Techniques:** Tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and text preprocessing.

### Dataset

The model is trained on the [Email Spam Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/email-spam-detection-dataset-classification) from Kaggle. This dataset provides a collection of emails labeled as spam or not spam, used for training and evaluating the spam detection model.

### Learning Objectives

- **NLP Model Development:** Gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow to develop and train NLP models for text classification.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Apply various NLP techniques to prepare and clean textual data.
- **API Deployment:** Learn to deploy machine learning models using Flask as an API.
- **Integration Skills:** Connect a Java frontend with a Flask API to deliver a practical application.

### Project Impact

This project provides practical experience in developing and deploying NLP models with TensorFlow, focusing on applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
